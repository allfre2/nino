 an ilegal move can happen if:


	1) the king goes to an attacked square.
	
	2) the king stays on an attaccked ray/square.

	3) A piece discovers the attack of a ray.


THIS CASES HAVE TO BE REMOVED WHEN THE MOVES ARE BEING
GENERATED.


	case 1)

	easily covered just moves & ~attakedbyoponent

	case 2)
	 all moves must interact with the rays or pieces
         that are attacking the king.
	 this case is only to be handled when the king is in
	 check.
	 and the special case when the king moves back in the same 
	 ray that it is being attacked.

	 # list pieces that are giving check and their rays.
	   proceed to eliminate all moves that dont interact
	   with this rays.
	   if one of the pieces is a knight moves must be 
	   just the king moves and the ones that take the knight
	   but if there are more than 1 hit/check just the king moves

	   then allways take in account the rays so not to fall
	   in check again.

	case 3)

	  most difficult case...
	  when king is in check all the moves will try to 
	  interact with the rays or pieces that are attacking
	  but they cant uncover new ones.

	  this case is to be handled when king is in check 
	  and when it's not.
